갈라디아서 : 4 장 1 절 What I am saying is that as long as an heir is underage, he is no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 2 절 The heir is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 3 절 So also, when we were underage, we were in slavery under the elemental spiritual forces of the world.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 4 절 But when the set time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,
갈라디아서 : 4 장 5 절 to redeem those under the law, that we might receive adoption to sonship.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 6 절 Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, “Abba, Father.”
갈라디아서 : 4 장 7 절 So you are no longer a slave, but God’s child; and since you are his child, God has made you also an heir.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 8 절 Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 9 절 But now that you know God—or rather are known by God—how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable forces? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again?
갈라디아서 : 4 장 10 절 You are observing special days and months and seasons and years!
갈라디아서 : 4 장 11 절 I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 12 절 I plead with you, brothers and sisters, become like me, for I became like you. You did me no wrong.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 13 절 As you know, it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you,
갈라디아서 : 4 장 14 절 and even though my illness was a trial to you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 15 절 Where, then, is your blessing of me now? I can testify that, if you could have done so, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 16 절 Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?
갈라디아서 : 4 장 17 절 Those people are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want is to alienate you from us, so that you may have zeal for them.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 18 절 It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always, not just when I am with you.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 19 절 My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you,
갈라디아서 : 4 장 20 절 how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you!
갈라디아서 : 4 장 21 절 Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says?
갈라디아서 : 4 장 22 절 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 23 절 His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a divine promise.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 24 절 These things are being taken figuratively: The women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 25 절 Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 26 절 But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 27 절 For it is written:
“Be glad, barren woman,
you who never bore a child;
shout for joy and cry aloud,
you who were never in labor;
because more are the children of the desolate woman
than of her who has a husband.”
갈라디아서 : 4 장 28 절 Now you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 29 절 At that time the son born according to the flesh persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 30 절 But what does Scripture say? “Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman’s son.”
갈라디아서 : 4 장 31 절 Therefore, brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 1 절 It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 2 절 Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 3 절 Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 4 절 You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 5 절 For through the Spirit we eagerly await by faith the righteousness for which we hope.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 6 절 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 7 절 You were running a good race. Who cut in on you to keep you from obeying the truth?
갈라디아서 : 5 장 8 절 That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 9 절 “A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough.”
갈라디아서 : 5 장 10 절 I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is throwing you into confusion, whoever that may be, will have to pay the penalty.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 11 절 Brothers and sisters, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 12 절 As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves!
갈라디아서 : 5 장 13 절 You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 14 절 For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”
갈라디아서 : 5 장 15 절 If you bite and devour each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 16 절 So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 17 절 For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 18 절 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 19 절 The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery;
갈라디아서 : 5 장 20 절 idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions
갈라디아서 : 5 장 21 절 and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 22 절 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
갈라디아서 : 5 장 23 절 gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 24 절 Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 25 절 Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 26 절 Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 1 절 Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently. But watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 2 절 Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 3 절 If anyone thinks they are something when they are not, they deceive themselves.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 4 절 Each one should test their own actions. Then they can take pride in themselves alone, without comparing themselves to someone else,
갈라디아서 : 6 장 5 절 for each one should carry their own load.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 6 절 Nevertheless, the one who receives instruction in the word should share all good things with their instructor.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 7 절 Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 8 절 Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 9 절 Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 10 절 Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 11 절 See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand!
갈라디아서 : 6 장 12 절 Those who want to impress people by means of the flesh are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 13 절 Not even those who are circumcised keep the law, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your circumcision in the flesh.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 14 절 May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 15 절 Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is the new creation.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 16 절 Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule—to the Israel of God.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 17 절 From now on, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 18 절 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers and sisters. Amen.
