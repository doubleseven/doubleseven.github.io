갈라디아서 : 4 장 1 절 Now I say that the heir, as long as he is a child, does not differ at all from a slave, though he is master of all,
갈라디아서 : 4 장 2 절 but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 3 절 Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 4 절 But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born  of a woman, born under the law,
갈라디아서 : 4 장 5 절 to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 6 절 And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, “Abba, Father!”
갈라디아서 : 4 장 7 절 Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 8 절 But then, indeed, when you did not know God, you served those which by nature are not gods.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 9 절 But now after you have known God, or rather are known by God, how is it that you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which you desire again to be in bondage?
갈라디아서 : 4 장 10 절 You observe days and months and seasons and years.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 11 절 I am afraid for you, lest I have labored for you in vain.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 12 절 Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I became like you. You have not injured me at all.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 13 절 You know that because of physical infirmity I preached the gospel to you at the first.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 14 절 And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 15 절 What then was the blessing you enjoyed? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 16 절 Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?
갈라디아서 : 4 장 17 절 They zealously court you, but for no good; yes, they want to exclude you, that you may be zealous for them.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 18 절 But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 19 절 My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you,
갈라디아서 : 4 장 20 절 I would like to be present with you now and to change my tone; for I have doubts about you.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 21 절 Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law?
갈라디아서 : 4 장 22 절 For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 23 절 But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through promise,
갈라디아서 : 4 장 24 절 which things are symbolic. For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar—
갈라디아서 : 4 장 25 절 for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children—
갈라디아서 : 4 장 26 절 but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 27 절 For it is written: “Rejoice, O barren, You who do not bear! Break forth and shout, You who are not in labor! For the desolate has many more children Than she who has a husband.”
갈라디아서 : 4 장 28 절 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 29 절 But, as he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, even so it is now.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 30 절 Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? “Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.”
갈라디아서 : 4 장 31 절 So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free.


갈라디아서 : 5 장 1 절 Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 2 절 Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 3 절 And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole law.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 4 절 You have become estranged from Christ, you who attempt to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 5 절 For we through the Spirit eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 6 절 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 7 절 You ran well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth?
갈라디아서 : 5 장 8 절 This persuasion does not come from Him who calls you.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 9 절 A little leaven leavens the whole lump.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 10 절 I have confidence in you, in the Lord, that you will have no other mind; but he who troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he is.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 11 절 And I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why do I still suffer persecution? Then the offense of the cross has ceased.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 12 절 I could wish that those who trouble you would even cut themselves off!
갈라디아서 : 5 장 13 절 For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not use liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 14 절 For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”
갈라디아서 : 5 장 15 절 But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another!
갈라디아서 : 5 장 16 절 I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 17 절 For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 18 절 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 19 절 Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness,
갈라디아서 : 5 장 20 절 idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies,
갈라디아서 : 5 장 21 절 envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 22 절 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
갈라디아서 : 5 장 23 절 gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 24 절 And those who are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 25 절 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 26 절 Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 1 절 Brethren, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, considering yourself lest you also be tempted.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 2 절 Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 3 절 For if anyone thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 4 절 But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 5 절 For each one shall bear his own load.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 6 절 Let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 7 절 Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 8 절 For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 9 절 And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 10 절 Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 11 절 See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand!
갈라디아서 : 6 장 12 절 As many as desire to make a good showing in the flesh, these would compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 13 절 For not even those who are circumcised keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 14 절 But God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 15 절 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but a new creation.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 16 절 And as many as walk according to this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 17 절 From now on let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 18 절 Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
