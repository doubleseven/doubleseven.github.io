갈라디아서 : 4 장 1 절 I mean that the heir, as long as he is a child, is no different from a slave, though he is the owner of everything,
갈라디아서 : 4 장 2 절 but he is under guardians and managers until the date set by his father.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 3 절 In the same way we also, when we were children, were enslaved to the elementary principles of the world.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 4 절 But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law,
갈라디아서 : 4 장 5 절 to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 6 절 And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba! Father!”
갈라디아서 : 4 장 7 절 So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 8 절 Formerly, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to those that by nature are not gods.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 9 절 But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world, whose slaves you want to be once more?
갈라디아서 : 4 장 10 절 You observe days and months and seasons and years!
갈라디아서 : 4 장 11 절 I am afraid I may have labored over you in vain.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 12 절 Brothers, I entreat you, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You did me no wrong.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 13 절 You know it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached the gospel to you at first,
갈라디아서 : 4 장 14 절 and though my condition was a trial to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 15 절 What then has become of the blessing you felt? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 16 절 Have I then become your enemy by telling you the truth?
갈라디아서 : 4 장 17 절 They make much of you, but for no good purpose. They want to shut you out, that you may make much of them.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 18 절 It is always good to be made much of for a good purpose, and not only when I am present with you,
갈라디아서 : 4 장 19 절 my little children, for whom I am again in the anguish of childbirth until Christ is formed in you!
갈라디아서 : 4 장 20 절 I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 21 절 Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not listen to the law?
갈라디아서 : 4 장 22 절 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and one by a free woman.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 23 절 But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, while the son of the free woman was born through promise.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 24 절 Now this may be interpreted allegorically: these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 25 절 Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 26 절 But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 27 절 For it is written, “Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear; break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor! For the children of the desolate one will be more than those of the one who has a husband.”
갈라디아서 : 4 장 28 절 Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 29 절 But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now.
갈라디아서 : 4 장 30 절 But what does the Scripture say? “Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.”
갈라디아서 : 4 장 31 절 So, brothers, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman.

갈라디아서 : 5 장 1 절 For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 2 절 Look: I, Paul, say to you that if you accept circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 3 절 I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that he is obligated to keep the whole law.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 4 절 You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 5 절 For through the Spirit, by faith, we ourselves eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 6 절 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 7 절 You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth?
갈라디아서 : 5 장 8 절 This persuasion is not from him who calls you.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 9 절 A little leaven leavens the whole lump.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 10 절 I have confidence in the Lord that you will take no other view than mine, and the one who is troubling you will bear the penalty, whoever he is.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 11 절 But if I, brothers, still preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been removed.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 12 절 I wish those who unsettle you would emasculate themselves!
갈라디아서 : 5 장 13 절 For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 14 절 For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”
갈라디아서 : 5 장 15 절 But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 16 절 But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 17 절 For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 18 절 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 19 절 Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality,
갈라디아서 : 5 장 20 절 idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions,
갈라디아서 : 5 장 21 절 envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 22 절 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
갈라디아서 : 5 장 23 절 gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 24 절 And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 25 절 If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.
갈라디아서 : 5 장 26 절 Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 1 절 Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 2 절 Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 3 절 For if anyone thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 4 절 But let each one test his own work, and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 5 절 For each will have to bear his own load.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 6 절 One who is taught the word must share all good things with the one who teaches.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 7 절 Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 8 절 For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 9 절 And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 10 절 So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to those who are of the household of faith.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 11 절 See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 12 절 It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh who would force you to be circumcised, and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 13 절 For even those who are circumcised do not themselves keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 14 절 But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 15 절 For neither circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 16 절 And as for all who walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 17 절 From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.
갈라디아서 : 6 장 18 절 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
