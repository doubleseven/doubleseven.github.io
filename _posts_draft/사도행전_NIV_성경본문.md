사도행전 : 1 장 1 절 In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach
사도행전 : 1 장 2 절 until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.
사도행전 : 1 장 3 절 After his suffering, he presented himself to them and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God.
사도행전 : 1 장 4 절 On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: “Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about.
사도행전 : 1 장 5 절 For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”
사도행전 : 1 장 6 절 Then they gathered around him and asked him, “Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?”
사도행전 : 1 장 7 절 He said to them: “It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority.
사도행전 : 1 장 8 절 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”
사도행전 : 1 장 9 절 After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight.
사도행전 : 1 장 10 절 They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them.
사도행전 : 1 장 11 절 “Men of Galilee,” they said, “why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.”
사도행전 : 1 장 12 절 Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives, a Sabbath day’s walk from the city.
사도행전 : 1 장 13 절 When they arrived, they went upstairs to the room where they were staying. Those present were Peter, John, James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James.
사도행전 : 1 장 14 절 They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
사도행전 : 1 장 15 절 In those days Peter stood up among the believers (a group numbering about a hundred and twenty)
사도행전 : 1 장 16 절 and said, “Brothers and sisters, the Scripture had to be fulfilled in which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through David concerning Judas, who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus.
사도행전 : 1 장 17 절 He was one of our number and shared in our ministry.”
사도행전 : 1 장 18 절 (With the payment he received for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out.
사도행전 : 1 장 19 절 Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)
사도행전 : 1 장 20 절 “For,” said Peter, “it is written in the Book of Psalms:
“ ‘May his place be deserted;
let there be no one to dwell in it,’
and,
“ ‘May another take his place of leadership.’
사도행전 : 1 장 21 절 Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus was living among us,
사도행전 : 1 장 22 절 beginning from John’s baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection.”
사도행전 : 1 장 23 절 So they nominated two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias.
사도행전 : 1 장 24 절 Then they prayed, “Lord, you know everyone’s heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen
사도행전 : 1 장 25 절 to take over this apostolic ministry, which Judas left to go where he belongs.”
사도행전 : 1 장 26 절 Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles.
사도행전 : 2 장 1 절 When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.
사도행전 : 2 장 2 절 Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.
사도행전 : 2 장 3 절 They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.
사도행전 : 2 장 4 절 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.
사도행전 : 2 장 5 절 Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven.
사도행전 : 2 장 6 절 When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard their own language being spoken.
사도행전 : 2 장 7 절 Utterly amazed, they asked: “Aren’t all these who are speaking Galileans?
사도행전 : 2 장 8 절 Then how is it that each of us hears them in our native language?
사도행전 : 2 장 9 절 Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
사도행전 : 2 장 10 절 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome
사도행전 : 2 장 11 절 (both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs—we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!”
사도행전 : 2 장 12 절 Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, “What does this mean?”
사도행전 : 2 장 13 절 Some, however, made fun of them and said, “They have had too much wine.”
사도행전 : 2 장 14 절 Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: “Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say.
사도행전 : 2 장 15 절 These people are not drunk, as you suppose. It’s only nine in the morning!
사도행전 : 2 장 16 절 No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:
사도행전 : 2 장 17 절 “ ‘In the last days, God says,
I will pour out my Spirit on all people.
Your sons and daughters will prophesy,
your young men will see visions,
your old men will dream dreams.
사도행전 : 2 장 18 절 Even on my servants, both men and women,
I will pour out my Spirit in those days,
and they will prophesy.
사도행전 : 2 장 19 절 I will show wonders in the heavens above
and signs on the earth below,
blood and fire and billows of smoke.
사도행전 : 2 장 20 절 The sun will be turned to darkness
and the moon to blood
before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.
사도행전 : 2 장 21 절 And everyone who calls
on the name of the Lord will be saved.’
사도행전 : 2 장 22 절 “Fellow Israelites, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know.
사도행전 : 2 장 23 절 This man was handed over to you by God’s deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross.
사도행전 : 2 장 24 절 But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.
사도행전 : 2 장 25 절 David said about him:
“ ‘I saw the Lord always before me.
Because he is at my right hand,
I will not be shaken.
사도행전 : 2 장 26 절 Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices;
my body also will rest in hope,
사도행전 : 2 장 27 절 because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead,
you will not let your holy one see decay.
사도행전 : 2 장 28 절 You have made known to me the paths of life;
you will fill me with joy in your presence.’
사도행전 : 2 장 29 절 “Fellow Israelites, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day.
사도행전 : 2 장 30 절 But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne.
사도행전 : 2 장 31 절 Seeing what was to come, he spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, that he was not abandoned to the realm of the dead, nor did his body see decay.
사도행전 : 2 장 32 절 God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of it.
사도행전 : 2 장 33 절 Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear.
사도행전 : 2 장 34 절 For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said,
“ ‘The Lord said to my Lord:
“Sit at my right hand
사도행전 : 2 장 35 절 until I make your enemies
a footstool for your feet.” ’
사도행전 : 2 장 36 절 “Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah.”
사도행전 : 2 장 37 절 When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?”
사도행전 : 2 장 38 절 Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
사도행전 : 2 장 39 절 The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call.”
사도행전 : 2 장 40 절 With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, “Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.”
사도행전 : 2 장 41 절 Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.
사도행전 : 2 장 42 절 They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
사도행전 : 2 장 43 절 Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles.
사도행전 : 2 장 44 절 All the believers were together and had everything in common.
사도행전 : 2 장 45 절 They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need.
사도행전 : 2 장 46 절 Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts,
사도행전 : 2 장 47 절 praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.
사도행전 : 3 장 1 절 One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer—at three in the afternoon.
사도행전 : 3 장 2 절 Now a man who was lame from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts.
사도행전 : 3 장 3 절 When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money.
사도행전 : 3 장 4 절 Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, “Look at us!”
사도행전 : 3 장 5 절 So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them.
사도행전 : 3 장 6 절 Then Peter said, “Silver or gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.”
사도행전 : 3 장 7 절 Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man’s feet and ankles became strong.
사도행전 : 3 장 8 절 He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping, and praising God.
사도행전 : 3 장 9 절 When all the people saw him walking and praising God,
사도행전 : 3 장 10 절 they recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
사도행전 : 3 장 11 절 While the man held on to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon’s Colonnade.
사도행전 : 3 장 12 절 When Peter saw this, he said to them: “Fellow Israelites, why does this surprise you? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk?
사도행전 : 3 장 13 절 The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus. You handed him over to be killed, and you disowned him before Pilate, though he had decided to let him go.
사도행전 : 3 장 14 절 You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a murderer be released to you.
사도행전 : 3 장 15 절 You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead. We are witnesses of this.
사도행전 : 3 장 16 절 By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong. It is Jesus’ name and the faith that comes through him that has completely healed him, as you can all see.
사도행전 : 3 장 17 절 “Now, fellow Israelites, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders.
사도행전 : 3 장 18 절 But this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, saying that his Messiah would suffer.
사도행전 : 3 장 19 절 Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord,
사도행전 : 3 장 20 절 and that he may send the Messiah, who has been appointed for you—even Jesus.
사도행전 : 3 장 21 절 Heaven must receive him until the time comes for God to restore everything, as he promised long ago through his holy prophets.
사도행전 : 3 장 22 절 For Moses said, ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you must listen to everything he tells you.
사도행전 : 3 장 23 절 Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off from their people.’
사도행전 : 3 장 24 절 “Indeed, beginning with Samuel, all the prophets who have spoken have foretold these days.
사도행전 : 3 장 25 절 And you are heirs of the prophets and of the covenant God made with your fathers. He said to Abraham, ‘Through your offspring all peoples on earth will be blessed.’
사도행전 : 3 장 26 절 When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways.”
사도행전 : 4 장 1 절 The priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to Peter and John while they were speaking to the people.
사도행전 : 4 장 2 절 They were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people, proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.
사도행전 : 4 장 3 절 They seized Peter and John and, because it was evening, they put them in jail until the next day.
사도행전 : 4 장 4 절 But many who heard the message believed; so the number of men who believed grew to about five thousand.
사도행전 : 4 장 5 절 The next day the rulers, the elders and the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem.
사도행전 : 4 장 6 절 Annas the high priest was there, and so were Caiaphas, John, Alexander and others of the high priest’s family.
사도행전 : 4 장 7 절 They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them: “By what power or what name did you do this?”
사도행전 : 4 장 8 절 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: “Rulers and elders of the people!
사도행전 : 4 장 9 절 If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a man who was lame and are being asked how he was healed,
사도행전 : 4 장 10 절 then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed.
사도행전 : 4 장 11 절 Jesus is
“ ‘the stone you builders rejected,
which has become the cornerstone.’
사도행전 : 4 장 12 절 Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.”
사도행전 : 4 장 13 절 When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus.
사도행전 : 4 장 14 절 But since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them, there was nothing they could say.
사도행전 : 4 장 15 절 So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin and then conferred together.
사도행전 : 4 장 16 절 “What are we going to do with these men?” they asked. “Everyone living in Jerusalem knows they have performed a notable sign, and we cannot deny it.
사도행전 : 4 장 17 절 But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people, we must warn them to speak no longer to anyone in this name.”
사도행전 : 4 장 18 절 Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
사도행전 : 4 장 19 절 But Peter and John replied, “Which is right in God’s eyes: to listen to you, or to him? You be the judges!
사도행전 : 4 장 20 절 As for us, we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.”
사도행전 : 4 장 21 절 After further threats they let them go. They could not decide how to punish them, because all the people were praising God for what had happened.
사도행전 : 4 장 22 절 For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old.
사도행전 : 4 장 23 절 On their release, Peter and John went back to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
사도행전 : 4 장 24 절 When they heard this, they raised their voices together in prayer to God. “Sovereign Lord,” they said, “you made the heavens and the earth and the sea, and everything in them.
사도행전 : 4 장 25 절 You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your servant, our father David:
“ ‘Why do the nations rage
and the peoples plot in vain?
사도행전 : 4 장 26 절 The kings of the earth rise up
and the rulers band together
against the Lord
and against his anointed one. ’
사도행전 : 4 장 27 절 Indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel in this city to conspire against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed.
사도행전 : 4 장 28 절 They did what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen.
사도행전 : 4 장 29 절 Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness.
사도행전 : 4 장 30 절 Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”
사도행전 : 4 장 31 절 After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.
사도행전 : 4 장 32 절 All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had.
사도행전 : 4 장 33 절 With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And God’s grace was so powerfully at work in them all
사도행전 : 4 장 34 절 that there were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales
사도행전 : 4 장 35 절 and put it at the apostles’ feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need.
사도행전 : 4 장 36 절 Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means “son of encouragement”),
사도행전 : 4 장 37 절 sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles’ feet.
사도행전 : 5 장 1 절 Now a man named Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, also sold a piece of property.
사도행전 : 5 장 2 절 With his wife’s full knowledge he kept back part of the money for himself, but brought the rest and put it at the apostles’ feet.
사도행전 : 5 장 3 절 Then Peter said, “Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land?
사도행전 : 5 장 4 절 Didn’t it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn’t the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied just to human beings but to God.”
사도행전 : 5 장 5 절 When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died. And great fear seized all who heard what had happened.
사도행전 : 5 장 6 절 Then some young men came forward, wrapped up his body, and carried him out and buried him.
사도행전 : 5 장 7 절 About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
사도행전 : 5 장 8 절 Peter asked her, “Tell me, is this the price you and Ananias got for the land?”
“Yes,” she said, “that is the price.”
사도행전 : 5 장 9 절 Peter said to her, “How could you conspire to test the Spirit of the Lord? Listen! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also.”
사도행전 : 5 장 10 절 At that moment she fell down at his feet and died. Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband.
사도행전 : 5 장 11 절 Great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events.
사도행전 : 5 장 12 절 The apostles performed many signs and wonders among the people. And all the believers used to meet together in Solomon’s Colonnade.
사도행전 : 5 장 13 절 No one else dared join them, even though they were highly regarded by the people.
사도행전 : 5 장 14 절 Nevertheless, more and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added to their number.
사도행전 : 5 장 15 절 As a result, people brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least Peter’s shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by.
사도행전 : 5 장 16 절 Crowds gathered also from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing their sick and those tormented by impure spirits, and all of them were healed.
사도행전 : 5 장 17 절 Then the high priest and all his associates, who were members of the party of the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy.
사도행전 : 5 장 18 절 They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail.
사도행전 : 5 장 19 절 But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and brought them out.
사도행전 : 5 장 20 절 “Go, stand in the temple courts,” he said, “and tell the people all about this new life.”
사도행전 : 5 장 21 절 At daybreak they entered the temple courts, as they had been told, and began to teach the people.
When the high priest and his associates arrived, they called together the Sanhedrin—the full assembly of the elders of Israel—and sent to the jail for the apostles.
사도행전 : 5 장 22 절 But on arriving at the jail, the officers did not find them there. So they went back and reported,
사도행전 : 5 장 23 절 “We found the jail securely locked, with the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside.”
사도행전 : 5 장 24 절 On hearing this report, the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests were at a loss, wondering what this might lead to.
사도행전 : 5 장 25 절 Then someone came and said, “Look! The men you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the people.”
사도행전 : 5 장 26 절 At that, the captain went with his officers and brought the apostles. They did not use force, because they feared that the people would stone them.
사도행전 : 5 장 27 절 The apostles were brought in and made to appear before the Sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest.
사도행전 : 5 장 28 절 “We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,” he said. “Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man’s blood.”
사도행전 : 5 장 29 절 Peter and the other apostles replied: “We must obey God rather than human beings!
사도행전 : 5 장 30 절 The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from the dead—whom you killed by hanging him on a cross.
사도행전 : 5 장 31 절 God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior that he might bring Israel to repentance and forgive their sins.
사도행전 : 5 장 32 절 We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.”
사도행전 : 5 장 33 절 When they heard this, they were furious and wanted to put them to death.
사도행전 : 5 장 34 절 But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a little while.
사도행전 : 5 장 35 절 Then he addressed the Sanhedrin: “Men of Israel, consider carefully what you intend to do to these men.
사도행전 : 5 장 36 절 Some time ago Theudas appeared, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing.
사도행전 : 5 장 37 절 After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt. He too was killed, and all his followers were scattered.
사도행전 : 5 장 38 절 Therefore, in the present case I advise you: Leave these men alone! Let them go! For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail.
사도행전 : 5 장 39 절 But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God.”
사도행전 : 5 장 40 절 His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
사도행전 : 5 장 41 절 The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.
사도행전 : 5 장 42 절 Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah.
사도행전 : 6 장 1 절 In those days when the number of disciples was increasing, the Hellenistic Jews among them complained against the Hebraic Jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food.
사도행전 : 6 장 2 절 So the Twelve gathered all the disciples together and said, “It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on tables.
사도행전 : 6 장 3 절 Brothers and sisters, choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will turn this responsibility over to them
사도행전 : 6 장 4 절 and will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word.”
사도행전 : 6 장 5 절 This proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit; also Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism.
사도행전 : 6 장 6 절 They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.
사도행전 : 6 장 7 절 So the word of God spread. The number of disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly, and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.
사도행전 : 6 장 8 절 Now Stephen, a man full of God’s grace and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people.
사도행전 : 6 장 9 절 Opposition arose, however, from members of the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called)—Jews of Cyrene and Alexandria as well as the provinces of Cilicia and Asia—who began to argue with Stephen.
사도행전 : 6 장 10 절 But they could not stand up against the wisdom the Spirit gave him as he spoke.
사도행전 : 6 장 11 절 Then they secretly persuaded some men to say, “We have heard Stephen speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God.”
사도행전 : 6 장 12 절 So they stirred up the people and the elders and the teachers of the law. They seized Stephen and brought him before the Sanhedrin.
사도행전 : 6 장 13 절 They produced false witnesses, who testified, “This fellow never stops speaking against this holy place and against the law.
사도행전 : 6 장 14 절 For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs Moses handed down to us.”
사도행전 : 6 장 15 절 All who were sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at Stephen, and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.
사도행전 : 7 장 1 절 Then the high priest asked Stephen, “Are these charges true?”
사도행전 : 7 장 2 절 To this he replied: “Brothers and fathers, listen to me! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Harran.
사도행전 : 7 장 3 절 ‘Leave your country and your people,’ God said, ‘and go to the land I will show you.’
사도행전 : 7 장 4 절 “So he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Harran. After the death of his father, God sent him to this land where you are now living.
사도행전 : 7 장 5 절 He gave him no inheritance here, not even enough ground to set his foot on. But God promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess the land, even though at that time Abraham had no child.
사도행전 : 7 장 6 절 God spoke to him in this way: ‘For four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated.
사도행전 : 7 장 7 절 But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves,’ God said, ‘and afterward they will come out of that country and worship me in this place.’

사도행전 : 7 장 33 절 “Then the Lord said to him, ‘Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.
사도행전 : 7 장 34 절 I have indeed seen the oppression of my people in Egypt. I have heard their groaning and have come down to set them free. Now come, I will send you back to Egypt.’

사도행전 : 7 장 36 절 He led them out of Egypt and performed wonders and signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea and for forty years in the wilderness.

사도행전 : 7 장 42 절 But God turned away from them and gave them over to the worship of the sun, moon and stars. This agrees with what is written in the book of the prophets:
“ ‘Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings
forty years in the wilderness, people of Israel?
사도행전 : 7 장 43 절 You have taken up the tabernacle of Molek
and the star of your god Rephan,
the idols you made to worship.
Therefore I will send you into exile’ beyond Babylon.

사도행전 : 7 장 45 절 After receiving the tabernacle, our ancestors under Joshua brought it with them when they took the land from the nations God drove out before them. It remained in the land until the time of David,

사도행전 : 7 장 47 절 But it was Solomon who built a house for him.
사도행전 : 7 장 48 절 “However, the Most High does not live in houses made by human hands. As the prophet says:

and the earth is my footstool.
What kind of house will you build for me?
says the Lord.
Or where will my resting place be?
사도행전 : 7 장 50 절 Has not my hand made all these things?’

사도행전 : 7 장 52 절 Was there ever a prophet your ancestors did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him—
사도행전 : 7 장 53 절 you who have received the law that was given through angels but have not obeyed it.”
사도행전 : 7 장 54 절 When the members of the Sanhedrin heard this, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him.
사도행전 : 7 장 55 절 But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
사도행전 : 7 장 56 절 “Look,” he said, “I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.”
사도행전 : 7 장 57 절 At this they covered their ears and, yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed at him,
사도행전 : 7 장 58 절 dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. Meanwhile, the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul.
사도행전 : 7 장 59 절 While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.”
사도행전 : 7 장 60 절 Then he fell on his knees and cried out, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” When he had said this, he fell asleep.
사도행전 : 8 장 1 절 And Saul approved of their killing him.

사도행전 : 8 장 2 절 Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him.
사도행전 : 8 장 3 절 But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off both men and women and put them in prison.
사도행전 : 8 장 4 절 Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went.
사도행전 : 8 장 5 절 Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Messiah there.
사도행전 : 8 장 6 절 When the crowds heard Philip and saw the signs he performed, they all paid close attention to what he said.
사도행전 : 8 장 7 절 For with shrieks, impure spirits came out of many, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed.
사도행전 : 8 장 8 절 So there was great joy in that city.
사도행전 : 8 장 9 절 Now for some time a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria. He boasted that he was someone great,
사도행전 : 8 장 10 절 and all the people, both high and low, gave him their attention and exclaimed, “This man is rightly called the Great Power of God.”
사도행전 : 8 장 11 절 They followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his sorcery.
사도행전 : 8 장 12 절 But when they believed Philip as he proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
사도행전 : 8 장 13 절 Simon himself believed and was baptized. And he followed Philip everywhere, astonished by the great signs and miracles he saw.
사도행전 : 8 장 14 절 When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to Samaria.
사도행전 : 8 장 15 절 When they arrived, they prayed for the new believers there that they might receive the Holy Spirit,
사도행전 : 8 장 16 절 because the Holy Spirit had not yet come on any of them; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
사도행전 : 8 장 17 절 Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
사도행전 : 8 장 18 절 When Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money
사도행전 : 8 장 19 절 and said, “Give me also this ability so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.”
사도행전 : 8 장 20 절 Peter answered: “May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money!
사도행전 : 8 장 21 절 You have no part or share in this ministry, because your heart is not right before God.
사도행전 : 8 장 22 절 Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord in the hope that he may forgive you for having such a thought in your heart.
사도행전 : 8 장 23 절 For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin.”
사도행전 : 8 장 24 절 Then Simon answered, “Pray to the Lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me.”
사도행전 : 8 장 25 절 After they had further proclaimed the word of the Lord and testified about Jesus, Peter and John returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages.
사도행전 : 8 장 26 절 Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Go south to the road—the desert road—that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.”
사도행전 : 8 장 27 절 So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official in charge of all the treasury of the Kandake (which means “queen of the Ethiopians”). This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship,
사도행전 : 8 장 28 절 and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the Book of Isaiah the prophet.
사도행전 : 8 장 29 절 The Spirit told Philip, “Go to that chariot and stay near it.”
사도행전 : 8 장 30 절 Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. “Do you understand what you are reading?” Philip asked.
사도행전 : 8 장 31 절 “How can I,” he said, “unless someone explains it to me?” So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
사도행전 : 8 장 32 절 This is the passage of Scripture the eunuch was reading:
“He was led like a sheep to the slaughter,
and as a lamb before its shearer is silent,
so he did not open his mouth.
사도행전 : 8 장 33 절 In his humiliation he was deprived of justice.
Who can speak of his descendants?
For his life was taken from the earth.”
사도행전 : 8 장 34 절 The eunuch asked Philip, “Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?”
사도행전 : 8 장 35 절 Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.
사도행전 : 8 장 36 절 As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, “Look, here is water. What can stand in the way of my being baptized?”
사도행전 : 8 장 37 절 [37]
사도행전 : 8 장 38 절 And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him.
사도행전 : 8 장 39 절 When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing.
사도행전 : 8 장 40 절 Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and traveled about, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.
사도행전 : 9 장 1 절 Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord’s disciples. He went to the high priest
사도행전 : 9 장 2 절 and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any there who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem.
사도행전 : 9 장 3 절 As he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.
사도행전 : 9 장 4 절 He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?”
사도행전 : 9 장 5 절 “Who are you, Lord?” Saul asked.
“I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,” he replied.
사도행전 : 9 장 6 절 “Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.”
사도행전 : 9 장 7 절 The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless; they heard the sound but did not see anyone.
사도행전 : 9 장 8 절 Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus.
사도행전 : 9 장 9 절 For three days he was blind, and did not eat or drink anything.
사도행전 : 9 장 10 절 In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, “Ananias!”
“Yes, Lord,” he answered.
사도행전 : 9 장 11 절 The Lord told him, “Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying.
사도행전 : 9 장 12 절 In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight.”
사도행전 : 9 장 13 절 “Lord,” Ananias answered, “I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem.
사도행전 : 9 장 14 절 And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.”
사도행전 : 9 장 15 절 But the Lord said to Ananias, “Go! This man is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel.
사도행전 : 9 장 16 절 I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.”
사도행전 : 9 장 17 절 Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord—Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here—has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”
사도행전 : 9 장 18 절 Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized,
사도행전 : 9 장 19 절 and after taking some food, he regained his strength.
Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus.
사도행전 : 9 장 20 절 At once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God.
사도행전 : 9 장 21 절 All those who heard him were astonished and asked, “Isn’t he the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasn’t he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?”
사도행전 : 9 장 22 절 Yet Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Messiah.
사도행전 : 9 장 23 절 After many days had gone by, there was a conspiracy among the Jews to kill him,
사도행전 : 9 장 24 절 but Saul learned of their plan. Day and night they kept close watch on the city gates in order to kill him.
사도행전 : 9 장 25 절 But his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall.
사도행전 : 9 장 26 절 When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple.
사도행전 : 9 장 27 절 But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of Jesus.
사도행전 : 9 장 28 절 So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.
사도행전 : 9 장 29 절 He talked and debated with the Hellenistic Jews, but they tried to kill him.
사도행전 : 9 장 30 절 When the believers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.
사도행전 : 9 장 31 절 Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace and was strengthened. Living in the fear of the Lord and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it increased in numbers.
사도행전 : 9 장 32 절 As Peter traveled about the country, he went to visit the Lord’s people who lived in Lydda.
사도행전 : 9 장 33 절 There he found a man named Aeneas, who was paralyzed and had been bedridden for eight years.
사도행전 : 9 장 34 절 “Aeneas,” Peter said to him, “Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and roll up your mat.” Immediately Aeneas got up.
사도행전 : 9 장 35 절 All those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.
사도행전 : 9 장 36 절 In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (in Greek her name is Dorcas); she was always doing good and helping the poor.
사도행전 : 9 장 37 절 About that time she became sick and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room.
사도행전 : 9 장 38 절 Lydda was near Joppa; so when the disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda, they sent two men to him and urged him, “Please come at once!”
사도행전 : 9 장 39 절 Peter went with them, and when he arrived he was taken upstairs to the room. All the widows stood around him, crying and showing him the robes and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was still with them.
사도행전 : 9 장 40 절 Peter sent them all out of the room; then he got down on his knees and prayed. Turning toward the dead woman, he said, “Tabitha, get up.” She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up.
사도행전 : 9 장 41 절 He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called for the believers, especially the widows, and presented her to them alive.
사도행전 : 9 장 42 절 This became known all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord.
사도행전 : 9 장 43 절 Peter stayed in Joppa for some time with a tanner named Simon.
사도행전 : 10 장 1 절 At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment.
사도행전 : 10 장 2 절 He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly.
사도행전 : 10 장 3 절 One day at about three in the afternoon he had a vision. He distinctly saw an angel of God, who came to him and said, “Cornelius!”
사도행전 : 10 장 4 절 Cornelius stared at him in fear. “What is it, Lord?” he asked.
The angel answered, “Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God.
사도행전 : 10 장 5 절 Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter.
사도행전 : 10 장 6 절 He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea.”
사도행전 : 10 장 7 절 When the angel who spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants.
사도행전 : 10 장 8 절 He told them everything that had happened and sent them to Joppa.
사도행전 : 10 장 9 절 About noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray.
사도행전 : 10 장 10 절 He became hungry and wanted something to eat, and while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance.
사도행전 : 10 장 11 절 He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners.
사도행전 : 10 장 12 절 It contained all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles and birds.
사도행전 : 10 장 13 절 Then a voice told him, “Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.”
사도행전 : 10 장 14 절 “Surely not, Lord!” Peter replied. “I have never eaten anything impure or unclean.”
사도행전 : 10 장 15 절 The voice spoke to him a second time, “Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.”
사도행전 : 10 장 16 절 This happened three times, and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven.
사도행전 : 10 장 17 절 While Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found out where Simon’s house was and stopped at the gate.
사도행전 : 10 장 18 절 They called out, asking if Simon who was known as Peter was staying there.
사도행전 : 10 장 19 절 While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Simon, three men are looking for you.
사도행전 : 10 장 20 절 So get up and go downstairs. Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them.”
사도행전 : 10 장 21 절 Peter went down and said to the men, “I’m the one you’re looking for. Why have you come?”
사도행전 : 10 장 22 절 The men replied, “We have come from Cornelius the centurion. He is a righteous and God-fearing man, who is respected by all the Jewish people. A holy angel told him to ask you to come to his house so that he could hear what you have to say.”
사도행전 : 10 장 23 절 Then Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests.
The next day Peter started out with them, and some of the believers from Joppa went along.
사도행전 : 10 장 24 절 The following day he arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.
사도행전 : 10 장 25 절 As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence.
사도행전 : 10 장 26 절 But Peter made him get up. “Stand up,” he said, “I am only a man myself.”
사도행전 : 10 장 27 절 While talking with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people.
사도행전 : 10 장 28 절 He said to them: “You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with or visit a Gentile. But God has shown me that I should not call anyone impure or unclean.
사도행전 : 10 장 29 절 So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you sent for me?”
사도행전 : 10 장 30 절 Cornelius answered: “Three days ago I was in my house praying at this hour, at three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me
사도행전 : 10 장 31 절 and said, ‘Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor.
사도행전 : 10 장 32 절 Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.’
사도행전 : 10 장 33 절 So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us.”
사도행전 : 10 장 34 절 Then Peter began to speak: “I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism
사도행전 : 10 장 35 절 but accepts from every nation the one who fears him and does what is right.
사도행전 : 10 장 36 절 You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, announcing the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all.
사도행전 : 10 장 37 절 You know what has happened throughout the province of Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached—
사도행전 : 10 장 38 절 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.
사도행전 : 10 장 39 절 “We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a cross,
사도행전 : 10 장 40 절 but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen.
사도행전 : 10 장 41 절 He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen—by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
사도행전 : 10 장 42 절 He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead.
사도행전 : 10 장 43 절 All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”
사도행전 : 10 장 44 절 While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message.
사도행전 : 10 장 45 절 The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on Gentiles.
사도행전 : 10 장 46 절 For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God.
Then Peter said,
사도행전 : 10 장 47 절 “Surely no one can stand in the way of their being baptized with water. They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.”
사도행전 : 10 장 48 절 So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.
사도행전 : 11 장 1 절 The apostles and the believers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
사도행전 : 11 장 2 절 So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him
사도행전 : 11 장 3 절 and said, “You went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them.”
사도행전 : 11 장 4 절 Starting from the beginning, Peter told them the whole story:
사도행전 : 11 장 5 절 “I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to where I was.
사도행전 : 11 장 6 절 I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles and birds.
사도행전 : 11 장 7 절 Then I heard a voice telling me, ‘Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.’
사도행전 : 11 장 8 절 “I replied, ‘Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’
사도행전 : 11 장 9 절 “The voice spoke from heaven a second time, ‘Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.’
사도행전 : 11 장 10 절 This happened three times, and then it was all pulled up to heaven again.
사도행전 : 11 장 11 절 “Right then three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying.
사도행전 : 11 장 12 절 The Spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man’s house.
사도행전 : 11 장 13 절 He told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say, ‘Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter.
사도행전 : 11 장 14 절 He will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved.’
사도행전 : 11 장 15 절 “As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning.
사도행전 : 11 장 16 절 Then I remembered what the Lord had said: ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’
사도행전 : 11 장 17 절 So if God gave them the same gift he gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could stand in God’s way?”
사도행전 : 11 장 18 절 When they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, “So then, even to Gentiles God has granted repentance that leads to life.”
사도행전 : 11 장 19 절 Now those who had been scattered by the persecution that broke out when Stephen was killed traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, spreading the word only among Jews.

사도행전 : 11 장 26 절 and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.

사도행전 : 12 장 2 절 He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword.

사도행전 : 12 장 4 절 After arresting him, he put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover.
사도행전 : 12 장 5 절 So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him.
사도행전 : 12 장 6 절 The night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries stood guard at the entrance.
사도행전 : 12 장 7 절 Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up. “Quick, get up!” he said, and the chains fell off Peter’s wrists.

사도행전 : 12 장 9 절 Peter followed him out of the prison, but he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening; he thought he was seeing a vision.
사도행전 : 12 장 10 절 They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city. It opened for them by itself, and they went through it. When they had walked the length of one street, suddenly the angel left him.
사도행전 : 12 장 11 절 Then Peter came to himself and said, “Now I know without a doubt that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from Herod’s clutches and from everything the Jewish people were hoping would happen.”

사도행전 : 12 장 16 절 But Peter kept on knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished.
사도행전 : 12 장 17 절 Peter motioned with his hand for them to be quiet and described how the Lord had brought him out of prison. “Tell James and the other brothers and sisters about this,” he said, and then he left for another place.
사도행전 : 12 장 18 절 In the morning, there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter.
사도행전 : 12 장 19 절 After Herod had a thorough search made for him and did not find him, he cross-examined the guards and ordered that they be executed.
Then Herod went from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.
사도행전 : 12 장 20 절 He had been quarreling with the people of Tyre and Sidon; they now joined together and sought an audience with him.

사도행전 : 12 장 21 절 On the appointed day Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people.
사도행전 : 12 장 22 절 They shouted, “This is the voice of a god, not of a man.”
사도행전 : 12 장 23 절 Immediately, because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.
사도행전 : 12 장 24 절 But the word of God continued to spread and flourish.
사도행전 : 12 장 25 절 When Barnabas and Saul had finished their mission, they returned from Jerusalem, taking with them John, also called Mark.
사도행전 : 13 장 1 절 Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch) and Saul.
사도행전 : 13 장 2 절 While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.”

사도행전 : 13 장 5 절 When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. John was with them as their helper.
사도행전 : 13 장 6 절 They traveled through the whole island until they came to Paphos. There they met a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus,
사도행전 : 13 장 7 절 who was an attendant of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus. The proconsul, an intelligent man, sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God.
사도행전 : 13 장 8 절 But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is what his name means) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul from the faith.
사도행전 : 13 장 9 절 Then Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight at Elymas and said,
사도행전 : 13 장 10 절 “You are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right! You are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery. Will you never stop perverting the right ways of the Lord?
사도행전 : 13 장 11 절 Now the hand of the Lord is against you. You are going to be blind for a time, not even able to see the light of the sun.”
Immediately mist and darkness came over him, and he groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand.
사도행전 : 13 장 12 절 When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was amazed at the teaching about the Lord.
사도행전 : 13 장 13 절 From Paphos, Paul and his companions sailed to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them to return to Jerusalem.
사도행전 : 13 장 14 절 From Perga they went on to Pisidian Antioch. On the Sabbath they entered the synagogue and sat down.
사도행전 : 13 장 15 절 After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the leaders of the synagogue sent word to them, saying, “Brothers, if you have a word of exhortation for the people, please speak.”
사도행전 : 13 장 16 절 Standing up, Paul motioned with his hand and said: “Fellow Israelites and you Gentiles who worship God, listen to me!
사도행전 : 13 장 17 절 The God of the people of Israel chose our ancestors; he made the people prosper during their stay in Egypt; with mighty power he led them out of that country;
사도행전 : 13 장 18 절 for about forty years he endured their conduct in the wilderness;
사도행전 : 13 장 19 절 and he overthrew seven nations in Canaan, giving their land to his people as their inheritance.
사도행전 : 13 장 20 절 All this took about 450 years.
“After this, God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet.
사도행전 : 13 장 21 절 Then the people asked for a king, and he gave them Saul son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, who ruled forty years.
사도행전 : 13 장 22 절 After removing Saul, he made David their king. God testified concerning him: ‘I have found David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart; he will do everything I want him to do.’

사도행전 : 13 장 29 절 When they had carried out all that was written about him, they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb.
사도행전 : 13 장 30 절 But God raised him from the dead,
사도행전 : 13 장 31 절 and for many days he was seen by those who had traveled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to our people.
사도행전 : 13 장 32 절 “We tell you the good news: What God promised our ancestors
사도행전 : 13 장 33 절 he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm:
“ ‘You are my son;
today I have become your father.’
사도행전 : 13 장 34 절 God raised him from the dead so that he will never be subject to decay. As God has said,
“ ‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.’
사도행전 : 13 장 35 절 So it is also stated elsewhere:
“ ‘You will not let your holy one see decay.’
사도행전 : 13 장 36 절 “Now when David had served God’s purpose in his own generation, he fell asleep; he was buried with his ancestors and his body decayed.

사도행전 : 13 장 41 절 “ ‘Look, you scoffers,
wonder and perish,
for I am going to do something in your days
that you would never believe,
even if someone told you.’ ”
사도행전 : 13 장 42 절 As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people invited them to speak further about these things on the next Sabbath.
사도행전 : 13 장 43 절 When the congregation was dismissed, many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked with them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.
사도행전 : 13 장 44 절 On the next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.
사도행전 : 13 장 45 절 When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy. They began to contradict what Paul was saying and heaped abuse on him.
사도행전 : 13 장 46 절 Then Paul and Barnabas answered them boldly: “We had to speak the word of God to you first. Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles.
사도행전 : 13 장 47 절 For this is what the Lord has commanded us:
“ ‘I have made you a light for the Gentiles,
that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.’ ”
사도행전 : 13 장 48 절 When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal life believed.
사도행전 : 13 장 49 절 The word of the Lord spread through the whole region.
사도행전 : 13 장 50 절 But the Jewish leaders incited the God-fearing women of high standing and the leading men of the city. They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their region.
사도행전 : 13 장 51 절 So they shook the dust off their feet as a warning to them and went to Iconium.
사도행전 : 13 장 52 절 And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
사도행전 : 14 장 1 절 At Iconium Paul and Barnabas went as usual into the Jewish synagogue. There they spoke so effectively that a great number of Jews and Greeks believed.
사도행전 : 14 장 2 절 But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the other Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.
사도행전 : 14 장 3 절 So Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time there, speaking boldly for the Lord, who confirmed the message of his grace by enabling them to perform signs and wonders.
사도행전 : 14 장 4 절 The people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews, others with the apostles.
사도행전 : 14 장 5 절 There was a plot afoot among both Gentiles and Jews, together with their leaders, to mistreat them and stone them.
사도행전 : 14 장 6 절 But they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding country,
사도행전 : 14 장 7 절 where they continued to preach the gospel.
사도행전 : 14 장 8 절 In Lystra there sat a man who was lame. He had been that way from birth and had never walked.
사도행전 : 14 장 9 절 He listened to Paul as he was speaking. Paul looked directly at him, saw that he had faith to be healed
사도행전 : 14 장 10 절 and called out, “Stand up on your feet!” At that, the man jumped up and began to walk.
사도행전 : 14 장 11 절 When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have come down to us in human form!”
사도행전 : 14 장 12 절 Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes because he was the chief speaker.
사도행전 : 14 장 13 절 The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them.
사도행전 : 14 장 14 절 But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting:
사도행전 : 14 장 15 절 “Friends, why are you doing this? We too are only human, like you. We are bringing you good news, telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and everything in them.
사도행전 : 14 장 16 절 In the past, he let all nations go their own way.
사도행전 : 14 장 17 절 Yet he has not left himself without testimony: He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons; he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy.”
사도행전 : 14 장 18 절 Even with these words, they had difficulty keeping the crowd from sacrificing to them.
사도행전 : 14 장 19 절 Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead.
사도행전 : 14 장 20 절 But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city. The next day he and Barnabas left for Derbe.
사도행전 : 14 장 21 절 They preached the gospel in that city and won a large number of disciples. Then they returned to Lystra, Iconium and Antioch,
사도행전 : 14 장 22 절 strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain true to the faith. “We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God,” they said.
사도행전 : 14 장 23 절 Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for them in each church and, with prayer and fasting, committed them to the Lord, in whom they had put their trust.
사도행전 : 14 장 24 절 After going through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia,
사도행전 : 14 장 25 절 and when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.
사도행전 : 14 장 26 절 From Attalia they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work they had now completed.
사도행전 : 14 장 27 절 On arriving there, they gathered the church together and reported all that God had done through them and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.
사도행전 : 14 장 28 절 And they stayed there a long time with the disciples.
사도행전 : 15 장 1 절 Certain people came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the believers: “Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by Moses, you cannot be saved.”
사도행전 : 15 장 2 절 This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question.
사도행전 : 15 장 3 절 The church sent them on their way, and as they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria, they told how the Gentiles had been converted. This news made all the believers very glad.
사도행전 : 15 장 4 절 When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and elders, to whom they reported everything God had done through them.
사도행전 : 15 장 5 절 Then some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, “The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to keep the law of Moses.”
사도행전 : 15 장 6 절 The apostles and elders met to consider this question.
사도행전 : 15 장 7 절 After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them: “Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe.
사도행전 : 15 장 8 절 God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us.
사도행전 : 15 장 9 절 He did not discriminate between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith.
사도행전 : 15 장 10 절 Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of Gentiles a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear?
사도행전 : 15 장 11 절 No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.”
사도행전 : 15 장 12 절 The whole assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul telling about the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them.
사도행전 : 15 장 13 절 When they finished, James spoke up. “Brothers,” he said, “listen to me.
사도행전 : 15 장 14 절 Simon has described to us how God first intervened to choose a people for his name from the Gentiles.
사도행전 : 15 장 15 절 The words of the prophets are in agreement with this, as it is written:
사도행전 : 15 장 16 절 “ ‘After this I will return
and rebuild David’s fallen tent.
Its ruins I will rebuild,
and I will restore it,
사도행전 : 15 장 17 절 that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord,
even all the Gentiles who bear my name,
says the Lord, who does these things’—
사도행전 : 15 장 18 절 things known from long ago.
사도행전 : 15 장 19 절 “It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God.
사도행전 : 15 장 20 절 Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood.
사도행전 : 15 장 21 절 For the law of Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.”
사도행전 : 15 장 22 절 Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, men who were leaders among the believers.
사도행전 : 15 장 23 절 With them they sent the following letter:
The apostles and elders, your brothers,
To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia:
Greetings.
사도행전 : 15 장 24 절 We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said.
사도행전 : 15 장 25 절 So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul—
사도행전 : 15 장 26 절 men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
사도행전 : 15 장 27 절 Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing.
사도행전 : 15 장 28 절 It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements:
사도행전 : 15 장 29 절 You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things.
Farewell.
사도행전 : 15 장 30 절 So the men were sent off and went down to Antioch, where they gathered the church together and delivered the letter.
사도행전 : 15 장 31 절 The people read it and were glad for its encouraging message.
사도행전 : 15 장 32 절 Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the believers.
사도행전 : 15 장 33 절 After spending some time there, they were sent off by the believers with the blessing of peace to return to those who had sent them.
사도행전 : 15 장 34 절 [34]
사도행전 : 15 장 35 절 But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, where they and many others taught and preached the word of the Lord.
사도행전 : 15 장 36 절 Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us go back and visit the believers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they are doing.”
사도행전 : 15 장 37 절 Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them,
사도행전 : 15 장 38 절 but Paul did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work.
사도행전 : 15 장 39 절 They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus,
사도행전 : 15 장 40 절 but Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the believers to the grace of the Lord.
사도행전 : 15 장 41 절 He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
사도행전 : 16 장 1 절 Paul came to Derbe and then to Lystra, where a disciple named Timothy lived, whose mother was Jewish and a believer but whose father was a Greek.
사도행전 : 16 장 2 절 The believers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him.
사도행전 : 16 장 3 절 Paul wanted to take him along on the journey, so he circumcised him because of the Jews who lived in that area, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
사도행전 : 16 장 4 절 As they traveled from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey.
사도행전 : 16 장 5 절 So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers.
사도행전 : 16 장 6 절 Paul and his companions traveled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in the province of Asia.
사도행전 : 16 장 7 절 When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to.
사도행전 : 16 장 8 절 So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas.
사도행전 : 16 장 9 절 During the night Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging him, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.”
사도행전 : 16 장 10 절 After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
사도행전 : 16 장 11 절 From Troas we put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace, and the next day we went on to Neapolis.
사도행전 : 16 장 12 절 From there we traveled to Philippi, a Roman colony and the leading city of that district of Macedonia. And we stayed there several days.
사도행전 : 16 장 13 절 On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there.
사도행전 : 16 장 14 절 One of those listening was a woman from the city of Thyatira named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth. She was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul’s message.
사도행전 : 16 장 15 절 When she and the members of her household were baptized, she invited us to her home. “If you consider me a believer in the Lord,” she said, “come and stay at my house.” And she persuaded us.
사도행전 : 16 장 16 절 Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a female slave who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling.
사도행전 : 16 장 17 절 She followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, “These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved.”
사도행전 : 16 장 18 절 She kept this up for many days. Finally Paul became so annoyed that he turned around and said to the spirit, “In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!” At that moment the spirit left her.
사도행전 : 16 장 19 절 When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities.
사도행전 : 16 장 20 절 They brought them before the magistrates and said, “These men are Jews, and are throwing our city into an uproar
사도행전 : 16 장 21 절 by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice.”
사도행전 : 16 장 22 절 The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods.
사도행전 : 16 장 23 절 After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully.
사도행전 : 16 장 24 절 When he received these orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.
사도행전 : 16 장 25 절 About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.
사도행전 : 16 장 26 절 Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everyone’s chains came loose.
사도행전 : 16 장 27 절 The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped.
사도행전 : 16 장 28 절 But Paul shouted, “Don’t harm yourself ! We are all here!”
사도행전 : 16 장 29 절 The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas.
사도행전 : 16 장 30 절 He then brought them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”
사도행전 : 16 장 31 절 They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household.”
사도행전 : 16 장 32 절 Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house.
사도행전 : 16 장 33 절 At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his household were baptized.
사도행전 : 16 장 34 절 The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God—he and his whole household.
사도행전 : 16 장 35 절 When it was daylight, the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with the order: “Release those men.”
사도행전 : 16 장 36 절 The jailer told Paul, “The magistrates have ordered that you and Silas be released. Now you can leave. Go in peace.”
사도행전 : 16 장 37 절 But Paul said to the officers: “They beat us publicly without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens, and threw us into prison. And now do they want to get rid of us quietly? No! Let them come themselves and escort us out.”
사도행전 : 16 장 38 절 The officers reported this to the magistrates, and when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were alarmed.
사도행전 : 16 장 39 절 They came to appease them and escorted them from the prison, requesting them to leave the city.
사도행전 : 16 장 40 절 After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia’s house, where they met with the brothers and sisters and encouraged them. Then they left.
사도행전 : 17 장 1 절 When Paul and his companions had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.
사도행전 : 17 장 2 절 As was his custom, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
사도행전 : 17 장 3 절 explaining and proving that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead. “This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Messiah,” he said.
사도행전 : 17 장 4 절 Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and quite a few prominent women.
사도행전 : 17 장 5 절 But other Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to Jason’s house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd.
사도행전 : 17 장 6 절 But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other believers before the city officials, shouting: “These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here,
사도행전 : 17 장 7 절 and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar’s decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.”
사도행전 : 17 장 8 절 When they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil.
사도행전 : 17 장 9 절 Then they made Jason and the others post bond and let them go.
사도행전 : 17 장 10 절 As soon as it was night, the believers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue.
사도행전 : 17 장 11 절 Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.
사도행전 : 17 장 12 절 As a result, many of them believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men.
사도행전 : 17 장 13 절 But when the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea, some of them went there too, agitating the crowds and stirring them up.
사도행전 : 17 장 14 절 The believers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed at Berea.
사도행전 : 17 장 15 절 Those who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible.
사도행전 : 17 장 16 절 While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols.
사도행전 : 17 장 17 절 So he reasoned in the synagogue with both Jews and God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there.
사도행전 : 17 장 18 절 A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to debate with him. Some of them asked, “What is this babbler trying to say?” Others remarked, “He seems to be advocating foreign gods.” They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.
사도행전 : 17 장 19 절 Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?
사도행전 : 17 장 20 절 You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we would like to know what they mean.”
사도행전 : 17 장 21 절 (All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.)
사도행전 : 17 장 22 절 Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: “People of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious.
사도행전 : 17 장 23 절 For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: to an unknown god. So you are ignorant of the very thing you worship—and this is what I am going to proclaim to you.
사도행전 : 17 장 24 절 “The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by human hands.
사도행전 : 17 장 25 절 And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything. Rather, he himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else.
사도행전 : 17 장 26 절 From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands.
사도행전 : 17 장 27 절 God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from any one of us.
사도행전 : 17 장 28 절 ‘For in him we live and move and have our being.’ As some of your own poets have said, ‘We are his offspring.’
사도행전 : 17 장 29 절 “Therefore since we are God’s offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone—an image made by human design and skill.
사도행전 : 17 장 30 절 In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent.
사도행전 : 17 장 31 절 For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.”
사도행전 : 17 장 32 절 When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, “We want to hear you again on this subject.”
사도행전 : 17 장 33 절 At that, Paul left the Council.
사도행전 : 17 장 34 절 Some of the people became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number of others.
사도행전 : 18 장 1 절 After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.
사도행전 : 18 장 2 절 There he met a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see them,
사도행전 : 18 장 3 절 and because he was a tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them.
사도행전 : 18 장 4 절 Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.
사도행전 : 18 장 5 절 When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.
사도행전 : 18 장 6 절 But when they opposed Paul and became abusive, he shook out his clothes in protest and said to them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent of it. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”
사도행전 : 18 장 7 절 Then Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titius Justus, a worshiper of God.
사도행전 : 18 장 8 절 Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his entire household believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and were baptized.
사도행전 : 18 장 9 절 One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: “Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent.
사도행전 : 18 장 10 절 For I am with you, and no one is going to attack and harm you, because I have many people in this city.”
사도행전 : 18 장 11 절 So Paul stayed in Corinth for a year and a half, teaching them the word of God.
사도행전 : 18 장 12 절 While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews of Corinth made a united attack on Paul and brought him to the place of judgment.
사도행전 : 18 장 13 절 “This man,” they charged, “is persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the law.”
사도행전 : 18 장 14 절 Just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to them, “If you Jews were making a complaint about some misdemeanor or serious crime, it would be reasonable for me to listen to you.
사도행전 : 18 장 15 절 But since it involves questions about words and names and your own law—settle the matter yourselves. I will not be a judge of such things.”
사도행전 : 18 장 16 절 So he drove them off.
사도행전 : 18 장 17 절 Then the crowd there turned on Sosthenes the synagogue leader and beat him in front of the proconsul; and Gallio showed no concern whatever.
사도행전 : 18 장 18 절 Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time. Then he left the brothers and sisters and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. Before he sailed, he had his hair cut off at Cenchreae because of a vow he had taken.
사도행전 : 18 장 19 절 They arrived at Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
사도행전 : 18 장 20 절 When they asked him to spend more time with them, he declined.
사도행전 : 18 장 21 절 But as he left, he promised, “I will come back if it is God’s will.” Then he set sail from Ephesus.
사도행전 : 18 장 22 절 When he landed at Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church and then went down to Antioch.
사도행전 : 18 장 23 절 After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out from there and traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
사도행전 : 18 장 24 절 Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures.
사도행전 : 18 장 25 절 He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he spoke with great fervor and taught about Jesus accurately, though he knew only the baptism of John.
사도행전 : 18 장 26 절 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately.
사도행전 : 18 장 27 절 When Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers and sisters encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. When he arrived, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed.
사도행전 : 18 장 28 절 For he vigorously refuted his Jewish opponents in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah.
사도행전 : 19 장 1 절 While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples
사도행전 : 19 장 2 절 and asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?”
They answered, “No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”
사도행전 : 19 장 3 절 So Paul asked, “Then what baptism did you receive?”
“John’s baptism,” they replied.
사도행전 : 19 장 4 절 Paul said, “John’s baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.”
사도행전 : 19 장 5 절 On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
사도행전 : 19 장 6 절 When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.
사도행전 : 19 장 7 절 There were about twelve men in all.
사도행전 : 19 장 8 절 Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God.
사도행전 : 19 장 9 절 But some of them became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way. So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.
사도행전 : 19 장 10 절 This went on for two years, so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord.
사도행전 : 19 장 11 절 God did extraordinary miracles through Paul,
사도행전 : 19 장 12 절 so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them.
사도행전 : 19 장 13 절 Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would say, “In the name of the Jesus whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out.”
사도행전 : 19 장 14 절 Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this.
사도행전 : 19 장 15 절 One day the evil spirit answered them, “Jesus I know, and Paul I know about, but who are you?”
사도행전 : 19 장 16 절 Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all. He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding.
사도행전 : 19 장 17 절 When this became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were all seized with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor.
사도행전 : 19 장 18 절 Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed what they had done.
사도행전 : 19 장 19 절 A number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas.
사도행전 : 19 장 20 절 In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power.
사도행전 : 19 장 21 절 After all this had happened, Paul decided to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia. “After I have been there,” he said, “I must visit Rome also.”
사도행전 : 19 장 22 절 He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed in the province of Asia a little longer.
사도행전 : 19 장 23 절 About that time there arose a great disturbance about the Way.
사도행전 : 19 장 24 절 A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought in a lot of business for the craftsmen there.
사도행전 : 19 장 25 절 He called them together, along with the workers in related trades, and said: “You know, my friends, that we receive a good income from this business.
사도행전 : 19 장 26 절 And you see and hear how this fellow Paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in Ephesus and in practically the whole province of Asia. He says that gods made by human hands are no gods at all.
사도행전 : 19 장 27 절 There is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited; and the goddess herself, who is worshiped throughout the province of Asia and the world, will be robbed of her divine majesty.”
사도행전 : 19 장 28 절 When they heard this, they were furious and began shouting: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”
사도행전 : 19 장 29 절 Soon the whole city was in an uproar. The people seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul’s traveling companions from Macedonia, and all of them rushed into the theater together.
사도행전 : 19 장 30 절 Paul wanted to appear before the crowd, but the disciples would not let him.
사도행전 : 19 장 31 절 Even some of the officials of the province, friends of Paul, sent him a message begging him not to venture into the theater.
사도행전 : 19 장 32 절 The assembly was in confusion: Some were shouting one thing, some another. Most of the people did not even know why they were there.
사도행전 : 19 장 33 절 The Jews in the crowd pushed Alexander to the front, and they shouted instructions to him. He motioned for silence in order to make a defense before the people.
사도행전 : 19 장 34 절 But when they realized he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”
사도행전 : 19 장 35 절 The city clerk quieted the crowd and said: “Fellow Ephesians, doesn’t all the world know that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image, which fell from heaven?
사도행전 : 19 장 36 절 Therefore, since these facts are undeniable, you ought to calm down and not do anything rash.
사도행전 : 19 장 37 절 You have brought these men here, though they have neither robbed temples nor blasphemed our goddess.
사도행전 : 19 장 38 절 If, then, Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a grievance against anybody, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. They can press charges.
사도행전 : 19 장 39 절 If there is anything further you want to bring up, it must be settled in a legal assembly.
사도행전 : 19 장 40 절 As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of what happened today. In that case we would not be able to account for this commotion, since there is no reason for it.”
사도행전 : 19 장 41 절 After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.
사도행전 : 20 장 1 절 When the uproar had ended, Paul sent for the disciples and, after encouraging them, said goodbye and set out for Macedonia.
사도행전 : 20 장 2 절 He traveled through that area, speaking many words of encouragement to the people, and finally arrived in Greece,
사도행전 : 20 장 3 절 where he stayed three months. Because some Jews had plotted against him just as he was about to sail for Syria, he decided to go back through Macedonia.
사도행전 : 20 장 4 절 He was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy also, and Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia.
사도행전 : 20 장 5 절 These men went on ahead and waited for us at Troas.
사도행전 : 20 장 6 절 But we sailed from Philippi after the Festival of Unleavened Bread, and five days later joined the others at Troas, where we stayed seven days.
사도행전 : 20 장 7 절 On the first day of the week we came together to break bread. Paul spoke to the people and, because he intended to leave the next day, kept on talking until midnight.
사도행전 : 20 장 8 절 There were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting.
사도행전 : 20 장 9 절 Seated in a window was a young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on. When he was sound asleep, he fell to the ground from the third story and was picked up dead.
사도행전 : 20 장 10 절 Paul went down, threw himself on the young man and put his arms around him. “Don’t be alarmed,” he said. “He’s alive!”
사도행전 : 20 장 11 절 Then he went upstairs again and broke bread and ate. After talking until daylight, he left.
사도행전 : 20 장 12 절 The people took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted.
사도행전 : 20 장 13 절 We went on ahead to the ship and sailed for Assos, where we were going to take Paul aboard. He had made this arrangement because he was going there on foot.
사도행전 : 20 장 14 절 When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard and went on to Mitylene.
사도행전 : 20 장 15 절 The next day we set sail from there and arrived off Chios. The day after that we crossed over to Samos, and on the following day arrived at Miletus.
사도행전 : 20 장 16 절 Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in the province of Asia, for he was in a hurry to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost.
사도행전 : 20 장 17 절 From Miletus, Paul sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church.
사도행전 : 20 장 18 절 When they arrived, he said to them: “You know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I came into the province of Asia.
사도행전 : 20 장 19 절 I served the Lord with great humility and with tears and in the midst of severe testing by the plots of my Jewish opponents.
사도행전 : 20 장 20 절 You know that I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and from house to house.
사도행전 : 20 장 21 절 I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus.
사도행전 : 20 장 22 절 “And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there.
사도행전 : 20 장 23 절 I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me.
사도행전 : 20 장 24 절 However, I consider my life worth nothing to me; my only aim is to finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me—the task of testifying to the good news of God’s grace.
사도행전 : 20 장 25 절 “Now I know that none of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will ever see me again.
사도행전 : 20 장 26 절 Therefore, I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of any of you.
사도행전 : 20 장 27 절 For I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God.
사도행전 : 20 장 28 절 Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood.
사도행전 : 20 장 29 절 I know that after I leave, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock.
사도행전 : 20 장 30 절 Even from your own number men will arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them.
사도행전 : 20 장 31 절 So be on your guard! Remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears.
사도행전 : 20 장 32 절 “Now I commit you to God and to the word of his grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
사도행전 : 20 장 33 절 I have not coveted anyone’s silver or gold or clothing.
사도행전 : 20 장 34 절 You yourselves know that these hands of mine have supplied my own needs and the needs of my companions.
사도행전 : 20 장 35 절 In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’ ”
사도행전 : 20 장 36 절 When Paul had finished speaking, he knelt down with all of them and prayed.
사도행전 : 20 장 37 절 They all wept as they embraced him and kissed him.
사도행전 : 20 장 38 절 What grieved them most was his statement that they would never see his face again. Then they accompanied him to the ship.
사도행전 : 21 장 1 절 After we had torn ourselves away from them, we put out to sea and sailed straight to Kos. The next day we went to Rhodes and from there to Patara.
사도행전 : 21 장 2 절 We found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, went on board and set sail.
사도행전 : 21 장 3 절 After sighting Cyprus and passing to the south of it, we sailed on to Syria. We landed at Tyre, where our ship was to unload its cargo.
사도행전 : 21 장 4 절 We sought out the disciples there and stayed with them seven days. Through the Spirit they urged Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.
사도행전 : 21 장 5 절 When it was time to leave, we left and continued on our way. All of them, including wives and children, accompanied us out of the city, and there on the beach we knelt to pray.
사도행전 : 21 장 6 절 After saying goodbye to each other, we went aboard the ship, and they returned home.
사도행전 : 21 장 7 절 We continued our voyage from Tyre and landed at Ptolemais, where we greeted the brothers and sisters and stayed with them for a day.
사도행전 : 21 장 8 절 Leaving the next day, we reached Caesarea and stayed at the house of Philip the evangelist, one of the Seven.
사도행전 : 21 장 9 절 He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.
사도행전 : 21 장 10 절 After we had been there a number of days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.
사도행전 : 21 장 11 절 Coming over to us, he took Paul’s belt, tied his own hands and feet with it and said, “The Holy Spirit says, ‘In this way the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem will bind the owner of this belt and will hand him over to the Gentiles.’ ”
사도행전 : 21 장 12 절 When we heard this, we and the people there pleaded with Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.
사도행전 : 21 장 13 절 Then Paul answered, “Why are you weeping and breaking my heart? I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”
사도행전 : 21 장 14 절 When he would not be dissuaded, we gave up and said, “The Lord’s will be done.”
사도행전 : 21 장 15 절 After this, we started on our way up to Jerusalem.
사도행전 : 21 장 16 절 Some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us and brought us to the home of Mnason, where we were to stay. He was a man from Cyprus and one of the early disciples.
사도행전 : 21 장 17 절 When we arrived at Jerusalem, the brothers and sisters received us warmly.
사도행전 : 21 장 18 절 The next day Paul and the rest of us went to see James, and all the elders were present.
사도행전 : 21 장 19 절 Paul greeted them and reported in detail what God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.
사도행전 : 21 장 20 절 When they heard this, they praised God. Then they said to Paul: “You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews have believed, and all of them are zealous for the law.
사도행전 : 21 장 21 절 They have been informed that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to turn away from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or live according to our customs.
사도행전 : 21 장 22 절 What shall we do? They will certainly hear that you have come,
사도행전 : 21 장 23 절 so do what we tell you. There are four men with us who have made a vow.
사도행전 : 21 장 24 절 Take these men, join in their purification rites and pay their expenses, so that they can have their heads shaved. Then everyone will know there is no truth in these reports about you, but that you yourself are living in obedience to the law.
사도행전 : 21 장 25 절 As for the Gentile believers, we have written to them our decision that they should abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality.”
사도행전 : 21 장 26 절 The next day Paul took the men and purified himself along with them. Then he went to the temple to give notice of the date when the days of purification would end and the offering would be made for each of them.
사도행전 : 21 장 27 절 When the seven days were nearly over, some Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul at the temple. They stirred up the whole crowd and seized him,
사도행전 : 21 장 28 절 shouting, “Fellow Israelites, help us! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people and our law and this place. And besides, he has brought Greeks into the temple and defiled this holy place.”
사도행전 : 21 장 29 절 (They had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul and assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple.)
사도행전 : 21 장 30 절 The whole city was aroused, and the people came running from all directions. Seizing Paul, they dragged him from the temple, and immediately the gates were shut.
사도행전 : 21 장 31 절 While they were trying to kill him, news reached the commander of the Roman troops that the whole city of Jerusalem was in an uproar.
사도행전 : 21 장 32 절 He at once took some officers and soldiers and ran down to the crowd. When the rioters saw the commander and his soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
사도행전 : 21 장 33 절 The commander came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains. Then he asked who he was and what he had done.
사도행전 : 21 장 34 절 Some in the crowd shouted one thing and some another, and since the commander could not get at the truth because of the uproar, he ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks.
사도행전 : 21 장 35 절 When Paul reached the steps, the violence of the mob was so great he had to be carried by the soldiers.
사도행전 : 21 장 36 절 The crowd that followed kept shouting, “Get rid of him!”
사도행전 : 21 장 37 절 As the soldiers were about to take Paul into the barracks, he asked the commander, “May I say something to you?”
“Do you speak Greek?” he replied.
사도행전 : 21 장 38 절 “Aren’t you the Egyptian who started a revolt and led four thousand terrorists out into the wilderness some time ago?”
사도행전 : 21 장 39 절 Paul answered, “I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city. Please let me speak to the people.”
사도행전 : 21 장 40 절 After receiving the commander’s permission, Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the crowd. When they were all silent, he said to them in Aramaic:
사도행전 : 22 장 1 절 “Brothers and fathers, listen now to my defense.”
사도행전 : 22 장 2 절 When they heard him speak to them in Aramaic, they became very quiet.
Then Paul said:
사도행전 : 22 장 3 절 “I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city. I studied under Gamaliel and was thoroughly trained in the law of our ancestors. I was just as zealous for God as any of you are today.
사도행전 : 22 장 4 절 I persecuted the followers of this Way to their death, arresting both men and women and throwing them into prison,
사도행전 : 22 장 5 절 as the high priest and all the Council can themselves testify. I even obtained letters from them to their associates in Damascus, and went there to bring these people as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished.
사도행전 : 22 장 6 절 “About noon as I came near Damascus, suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me.
사도행전 : 22 장 7 절 I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, ‘Saul! Saul! Why do you persecute me?’
사도행전 : 22 장 8 절 “ ‘Who are you, Lord?’ I asked.
“ ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting,’ he replied.
사도행전 : 22 장 9 절 My companions saw the light, but they did not understand the voice of him who was speaking to me.
사도행전 : 22 장 10 절 “ ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ I asked.
“ ‘Get up,’ the Lord said, ‘and go into Damascus. There you will be told all that you have been assigned to do.’
사도행전 : 22 장 11 절 My companions led me by the hand into Damascus, because the brilliance of the light had blinded me.
사도행전 : 22 장 12 절 “A man named Ananias came to see me. He was a devout observer of the law and highly respected by all the Jews living there.
사도행전 : 22 장 13 절 He stood beside me and said, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight!’ And at that very moment I was able to see him.
사도행전 : 22 장 14 절 “Then he said: ‘The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear words from his mouth.
사도행전 : 22 장 15 절 You will be his witness to all people of what you have seen and heard.
사도행전 : 22 장 16 절 And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name.’
사도행전 : 22 장 17 절 “When I returned to Jerusalem and was praying at the temple, I fell into a trance
사도행전 : 22 장 18 절 and saw the Lord speaking to me. ‘Quick!’ he said. ‘Leave Jerusalem immediately, because the people here will not accept your testimony about me.’
사도행전 : 22 장 19 절 “ ‘Lord,’ I replied, ‘these people know that I went from one synagogue to another to imprison and beat those who believe in you.
사도행전 : 22 장 20 절 And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I stood there giving my approval and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.’
사도행전 : 22 장 21 절 “Then the Lord said to me, ‘Go; I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’ ”
사도행전 : 22 장 22 절 The crowd listened to Paul until he said this. Then they raised their voices and shouted, “Rid the earth of him! He’s not fit to live!”
사도행전 : 22 장 23 절 As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air,
사도행전 : 22 장 24 절 the commander ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks. He directed that he be flogged and interrogated in order to find out why the people were shouting at him like this.
사도행전 : 22 장 25 절 As they stretched him out to flog him, Paul said to the centurion standing there, “Is it legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who hasn’t even been found guilty?”
사도행전 : 22 장 26 절 When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and reported it. “What are you going to do?” he asked. “This man is a Roman citizen.”
사도행전 : 22 장 27 절 The commander went to Paul and asked, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?”
“Yes, I am,” he answered.
사도행전 : 22 장 28 절 Then the commander said, “I had to pay a lot of money for my citizenship.”
“But I was born a citizen,” Paul replied.
사도행전 : 22 장 29 절 Those who were about to interrogate him withdrew immediately. The commander himself was alarmed when he realized that he had put Paul, a Roman citizen, in chains.
사도행전 : 22 장 30 절 The commander wanted to find out exactly why Paul was being accused by the Jews. So the next day he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the members of the Sanhedrin to assemble. Then he brought Paul and had him stand before them.
사도행전 : 23 장 1 절 Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin and said, “My brothers, I have fulfilled my duty to God in all good conscience to this day.”
사도행전 : 23 장 2 절 At this the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth.
사도행전 : 23 장 3 절 Then Paul said to him, “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck!”
사도행전 : 23 장 4 절 Those who were standing near Paul said, “How dare you insult God’s high priest!”
사도행전 : 23 장 5 절 Paul replied, “Brothers, I did not realize that he was the high priest; for it is written: ‘Do not speak evil about the ruler of your people.’ ”
사도행전 : 23 장 6 절 Then Paul, knowing that some of them were Sadducees and the others Pharisees, called out in the Sanhedrin, “My brothers, I am a Pharisee, descended from Pharisees. I stand on trial because of the hope of the resurrection of the dead.”
사도행전 : 23 장 7 절 When he said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
사도행전 : 23 장 8 절 (The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, and that there are neither angels nor spirits, but the Pharisees believe all these things.)
사도행전 : 23 장 9 절 There was a great uproar, and some of the teachers of the law who were Pharisees stood up and argued vigorously. “We find nothing wrong with this man,” they said. “What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?”
사도행전 : 23 장 10 절 The dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them. He ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force and bring him into the barracks.
사도행전 : 23 장 11 절 The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said, “Take courage! As you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome.”
사도행전 : 23 장 12 절 The next morning some Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul.
사도행전 : 23 장 13 절 More than forty men were involved in this plot.
사도행전 : 23 장 14 절 They went to the chief priests and the elders and said, “We have taken a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed Paul.
사도행전 : 23 장 15 절 Now then, you and the Sanhedrin petition the commander to bring him before you on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about his case. We are ready to kill him before he gets here.”
사도행전 : 23 장 16 절 But when the son of Paul’s sister heard of this plot, he went into the barracks and told Paul.
사도행전 : 23 장 17 절 Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the commander; he has something to tell him.”
사도행전 : 23 장 18 절 So he took him to the commander.
The centurion said, “Paul, the prisoner, sent for me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.”
사도행전 : 23 장 19 절 The commander took the young man by the hand, drew him aside and asked, “What is it you want to tell me?”
사도행전 : 23 장 20 절 He said: “Some Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul before the Sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about him.
사도행전 : 23 장 21 절 Don’t give in to them, because more than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him. They have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They are ready now, waiting for your consent to their request.”
사도행전 : 23 장 22 절 The commander dismissed the young man with this warning: “Don’t tell anyone that you have reported this to me.”
사도행전 : 23 장 23 절 Then he called two of his centurions and ordered them, “Get ready a detachment of two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea at nine tonight.
사도행전 : 23 장 24 절 Provide horses for Paul so that he may be taken safely to Governor Felix.”
사도행전 : 23 장 25 절 He wrote a letter as follows:
사도행전 : 23 장 26 절 Claudius Lysias,
To His Excellency, Governor Felix:
Greetings.
사도행전 : 23 장 27 절 This man was seized by the Jews and they were about to kill him, but I came with my troops and rescued him, for I had learned that he is a Roman citizen.
사도행전 : 23 장 28 절 I wanted to know why they were accusing him, so I brought him to their Sanhedrin.
사도행전 : 23 장 29 절 I found that the accusation had to do with questions about their law, but there was no charge against him that deserved death or imprisonment.
사도행전 : 23 장 30 절 When I was informed of a plot to be carried out against the man, I sent him to you at once. I also ordered his accusers to present to you their case against him.
사도행전 : 23 장 31 절 So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul with them during the night and brought him as far as Antipatris.
사도행전 : 23 장 32 절 The next day they let the cavalry go on with him, while they returned to the barracks.
사도행전 : 23 장 33 절 When the cavalry arrived in Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and handed Paul over to him.
사도행전 : 23 장 34 절 The governor read the letter and asked what province he was from. Learning that he was from Cilicia,
사도행전 : 23 장 35 절 he said, “I will hear your case when your accusers get here.” Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod’s palace.
사도행전 : 24 장 1 절 Five days later the high priest Ananias went down to Caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they brought their charges against Paul before the governor.
사도행전 : 24 장 2 절 When Paul was called in, Tertullus presented his case before Felix: “We have enjoyed a long period of peace under you, and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation.
사도행전 : 24 장 3 절 Everywhere and in every way, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with profound gratitude.
사도행전 : 24 장 4 절 But in order not to weary you further, I would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly.
사도행전 : 24 장 5 절 “We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect
사도행전 : 24 장 6 절 and even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him.
사도행전 : 24 장 7 절 [7]
사도행전 : 24 장 8 절 By examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him.”
사도행전 : 24 장 9 절 The other Jews joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were true.
사도행전 : 24 장 10 절 When the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied: “I know that for a number of years you have been a judge over this nation; so I gladly make my defense.
사도행전 : 24 장 11 절 You can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
사도행전 : 24 장 12 절 My accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple, or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city.
사도행전 : 24 장 13 절 And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me.
사도행전 : 24 장 14 절 However, I admit that I worship the God of our ancestors as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets,
사도행전 : 24 장 15 절 and I have the same hope in God as these men themselves have, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.
사도행전 : 24 장 16 절 So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man.
사도행전 : 24 장 17 절 “After an absence of several years, I came to Jerusalem to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings.
사도행전 : 24 장 18 절 I was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this. There was no crowd with me, nor was I involved in any disturbance.
사도행전 : 24 장 19 절 But there are some Jews from the province of Asia, who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me.
사도행전 : 24 장 20 절 Or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin—
사도행전 : 24 장 21 절 unless it was this one thing I shouted as I stood in their presence: ‘It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.’ ”
사도행전 : 24 장 22 절 Then Felix, who was well acquainted with the Way, adjourned the proceedings. “When Lysias the commander comes,” he said, “I will decide your case.”
사도행전 : 24 장 23 절 He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs.
사도행전 : 24 장 24 절 Several days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus.
사도행전 : 24 장 25 절 As Paul talked about righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and said, “That’s enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient, I will send for you.”
사도행전 : 24 장 26 절 At the same time he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe, so he sent for him frequently and talked with him.
사도행전 : 24 장 27 절 When two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, but because Felix wanted to grant a favor to the Jews, he left Paul in prison.
사도행전 : 25 장 1 절 Three days after arriving in the province, Festus went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem,
사도행전 : 25 장 2 절 where the chief priests and the Jewish leaders appeared before him and presented the charges against Paul.
사도행전 : 25 장 3 절 They requested Festus, as a favor to them, to have Paul transferred to Jerusalem, for they were preparing an ambush to kill him along the way.
사도행전 : 25 장 4 절 Festus answered, “Paul is being held at Caesarea, and I myself am going there soon.
사도행전 : 25 장 5 절 Let some of your leaders come with me, and if the man has done anything wrong, they can press charges against him there.”
사도행전 : 25 장 6 절 After spending eight or ten days with them, Festus went down to Caesarea. The next day he convened the court and ordered that Paul be brought before him.
사도행전 : 25 장 7 절 When Paul came in, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him. They brought many serious charges against him, but they could not prove them.
사도행전 : 25 장 8 절 Then Paul made his defense: “I have done nothing wrong against the Jewish law or against the temple or against Caesar.”
사도행전 : 25 장 9 절 Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me there on these charges?”
사도행전 : 25 장 10 절 Paul answered: “I am now standing before Caesar’s court, where I ought to be tried. I have not done any wrong to the Jews, as you yourself know very well.
사도행전 : 25 장 11 절 If, however, I am guilty of doing anything deserving death, I do not refuse to die. But if the charges brought against me by these Jews are not true, no one has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!”
사도행전 : 25 장 12 절 After Festus had conferred with his council, he declared: “You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you will go!”
사도행전 : 25 장 13 절 A few days later King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus.
사도행전 : 25 장 14 절 Since they were spending many days there, Festus discussed Paul’s case with the king. He said: “There is a man here whom Felix left as a prisoner.
사도행전 : 25 장 15 절 When I went to Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against him and asked that he be condemned.
사도행전 : 25 장 16 절 “I told them that it is not the Roman custom to hand over anyone before they have faced their accusers and have had an opportunity to defend themselves against the charges.
사도행전 : 25 장 17 절 When they came here with me, I did not delay the case, but convened the court the next day and ordered the man to be brought in.
사도행전 : 25 장 18 절 When his accusers got up to speak, they did not charge him with any of the crimes I had expected.
사도행전 : 25 장 19 절 Instead, they had some points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a dead man named Jesus who Paul claimed was alive.
사도행전 : 25 장 20 절 I was at a loss how to investigate such matters; so I asked if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and stand trial there on these charges.
사도행전 : 25 장 21 절 But when Paul made his appeal to be held over for the Emperor’s decision, I ordered him held until I could send him to Caesar.”
사도행전 : 25 장 22 절 Then Agrippa said to Festus, “I would like to hear this man myself.”
He replied, “Tomorrow you will hear him.”
사도행전 : 25 장 23 절 The next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience room with the high-ranking military officers and the prominent men of the city. At the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.
사도행전 : 25 장 24 절 Festus said: “King Agrippa, and all who are present with us, you see this man! The whole Jewish community has petitioned me about him in Jerusalem and here in Caesarea, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.
사도행전 : 25 장 25 절 I found he had done nothing deserving of death, but because he made his appeal to the Emperor I decided to send him to Rome.
사도행전 : 25 장 26 절 But I have nothing definite to write to His Majesty about him. Therefore I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that as a result of this investigation I may have something to write.
사도행전 : 25 장 27 절 For I think it is unreasonable to send a prisoner on to Rome without specifying the charges against him.”
사도행전 : 26 장 1 절 Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You have permission to speak for yourself.”
So Paul motioned with his hand and began his defense:
사도행전 : 26 장 2 절 “King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate to stand before you today as I make my defense against all the accusations of the Jews,
사도행전 : 26 장 3 절 and especially so because you are well acquainted with all the Jewish customs and controversies. Therefore, I beg you to listen to me patiently.
사도행전 : 26 장 4 절 “The Jewish people all know the way I have lived ever since I was a child, from the beginning of my life in my own country, and also in Jerusalem.
사도행전 : 26 장 5 절 They have known me for a long time and can testify, if they are willing, that I conformed to the strictest sect of our religion, living as a Pharisee.
사도행전 : 26 장 6 절 And now it is because of my hope in what God has promised our ancestors that I am on trial today.
사도행전 : 26 장 7 절 This is the promise our twelve tribes are hoping to see fulfilled as they earnestly serve God day and night. King Agrippa, it is because of this hope that these Jews are accusing me.
사도행전 : 26 장 8 절 Why should any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead?
사도행전 : 26 장 9 절 “I too was convinced that I ought to do all that was possible to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
사도행전 : 26 장 10 절 And that is just what I did in Jerusalem. On the authority of the chief priests I put many of the Lord’s people in prison, and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them.
사도행전 : 26 장 11 절 Many a time I went from one synagogue to another to have them punished, and I tried to force them to blaspheme. I was so obsessed with persecuting them that I even hunted them down in foreign cities.
사도행전 : 26 장 12 절 “On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests.
사도행전 : 26 장 13 절 About noon, King Agrippa, as I was on the road, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, blazing around me and my companions.
사도행전 : 26 장 14 절 We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic, ‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.’
사도행전 : 26 장 15 절 “Then I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’
“ ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,’ the Lord replied.
사도행전 : 26 장 16 절 ‘Now get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen and will see of me.
사도행전 : 26 장 17 절 I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them
사도행전 : 26 장 18 절 to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’
사도행전 : 26 장 19 절 “So then, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the vision from heaven.
사도행전 : 26 장 20 절 First to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and then to the Gentiles, I preached that they should repent and turn to God and demonstrate their repentance by their deeds.
사도행전 : 26 장 21 절 That is why some Jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me.
사도행전 : 26 장 22 절 But God has helped me to this very day; so I stand here and testify to small and great alike. I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen—
사도행전 : 26 장 23 절 that the Messiah would suffer and, as the first to rise from the dead, would bring the message of light to his own people and to the Gentiles.”
사도행전 : 26 장 24 절 At this point Festus interrupted Paul’s defense. “You are out of your mind, Paul!” he shouted. “Your great learning is driving you insane.”
사도행전 : 26 장 25 절 “I am not insane, most excellent Festus,” Paul replied. “What I am saying is true and reasonable.
사도행전 : 26 장 26 절 The king is familiar with these things, and I can speak freely to him. I am convinced that none of this has escaped his notice, because it was not done in a corner.
사도행전 : 26 장 27 절 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do.”
사도행전 : 26 장 28 절 Then Agrippa said to Paul, “Do you think that in such a short time you can persuade me to be a Christian?”
사도행전 : 26 장 29 절 Paul replied, “Short time or long—I pray to God that not only you but all who are listening to me today may become what I am, except for these chains.”
사도행전 : 26 장 30 절 The king rose, and with him the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them.
사도행전 : 26 장 31 절 After they left the room, they began saying to one another, “This man is not doing anything that deserves death or imprisonment.”
사도행전 : 26 장 32 절 Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.”
사도행전 : 27 장 1 절 When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who belonged to the Imperial Regiment.
사도행전 : 27 장 2 절 We boarded a ship from Adramyttium about to sail for ports along the coast of the province of Asia, and we put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us.
사도행전 : 27 장 3 절 The next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius, in kindness to Paul, allowed him to go to his friends so they might provide for his needs.
사도행전 : 27 장 4 절 From there we put out to sea again and passed to the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us.
사도행전 : 27 장 5 절 When we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia.
사도행전 : 27 장 6 절 There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board.
사도행전 : 27 장 7 절 We made slow headway for many days and had difficulty arriving off Cnidus. When the wind did not allow us to hold our course, we sailed to the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone.
사도행전 : 27 장 8 절 We moved along the coast with difficulty and came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.
사도행전 : 27 장 9 절 Much time had been lost, and sailing had already become dangerous because by now it was after the Day of Atonement. So Paul warned them,
사도행전 : 27 장 10 절 “Men, I can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss to ship and cargo, and to our own lives also.”
사도행전 : 27 장 11 절 But the centurion, instead of listening to what Paul said, followed the advice of the pilot and of the owner of the ship.
사도행전 : 27 장 12 절 Since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided that we should sail on, hoping to reach Phoenix and winter there. This was a harbor in Crete, facing both southwest and northwest.
사도행전 : 27 장 13 절 When a gentle south wind began to blow, they saw their opportunity; so they weighed anchor and sailed along the shore of Crete.
사도행전 : 27 장 14 절 Before very long, a wind of hurricane force, called the Northeaster, swept down from the island.
사도행전 : 27 장 15 절 The ship was caught by the storm and could not head into the wind; so we gave way to it and were driven along.
사도행전 : 27 장 16 절 As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were hardly able to make the lifeboat secure,
사도행전 : 27 장 17 절 so the men hoisted it aboard. Then they passed ropes under the ship itself to hold it together. Because they were afraid they would run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and let the ship be driven along.
사도행전 : 27 장 18 절 We took such a violent battering from the storm that the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard.
사도행전 : 27 장 19 절 On the third day, they threw the ship’s tackle overboard with their own hands.
사도행전 : 27 장 20 절 When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging, we finally gave up all hope of being saved.
사도행전 : 27 장 21 절 After they had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up before them and said: “Men, you should have taken my advice not to sail from Crete; then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss.
사도행전 : 27 장 22 절 But now I urge you to keep up your courage, because not one of you will be lost; only the ship will be destroyed.
사도행전 : 27 장 23 절 Last night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood beside me
사도행전 : 27 장 24 절 and said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand trial before Caesar; and God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.’
사도행전 : 27 장 25 절 So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen just as he told me.
사도행전 : 27 장 26 절 Nevertheless, we must run aground on some island.”
사도행전 : 27 장 27 절 On the fourteenth night we were still being driven across the Adriatic Sea, when about midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land.
사도행전 : 27 장 28 절 They took soundings and found that the water was a hundred and twenty feet deep. A short time later they took soundings again and found it was ninety feet deep.
사도행전 : 27 장 29 절 Fearing that we would be dashed against the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight.
사도행전 : 27 장 30 절 In an attempt to escape from the ship, the sailors let the lifeboat down into the sea, pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow.
사도행전 : 27 장 31 절 Then Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved.”
사도행전 : 27 장 32 절 So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it drift away.
사도행전 : 27 장 33 절 Just before dawn Paul urged them all to eat. “For the last fourteen days,” he said, “you have been in constant suspense and have gone without food—you haven’t eaten anything.
사도행전 : 27 장 34 절 Now I urge you to take some food. You need it to survive. Not one of you will lose a single hair from his head.”
사도행전 : 27 장 35 절 After he said this, he took some bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat.
사도행전 : 27 장 36 절 They were all encouraged and ate some food themselves.
사도행전 : 27 장 37 절 Altogether there were 276 of us on board.
사도행전 : 27 장 38 절 When they had eaten as much as they wanted, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.
사도행전 : 27 장 39 절 When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could.
사도행전 : 27 장 40 절 Cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea and at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach.
사도행전 : 27 장 41 절 But the ship struck a sandbar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would not move, and the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the surf.
사도행전 : 27 장 42 절 The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from swimming away and escaping.
사도행전 : 27 장 43 절 But the centurion wanted to spare Paul’s life and kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land.
사도행전 : 27 장 44 절 The rest were to get there on planks or on other pieces of the ship. In this way everyone reached land safely.
사도행전 : 28 장 1 절 Once safely on shore, we found out that the island was called Malta.
사도행전 : 28 장 2 절 The islanders showed us unusual kindness. They built a fire and welcomed us all because it was raining and cold.
사도행전 : 28 장 3 절 Paul gathered a pile of brushwood and, as he put it on the fire, a viper, driven out by the heat, fastened itself on his hand.
사도행전 : 28 장 4 절 When the islanders saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to each other, “This man must be a murderer; for though he escaped from the sea, the goddess Justice has not allowed him to live.”
사도행전 : 28 장 5 절 But Paul shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no ill effects.
사도행전 : 28 장 6 절 The people expected him to swell up or suddenly fall dead; but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.
사도행전 : 28 장 7 절 There was an estate nearby that belonged to Publius, the chief official of the island. He welcomed us to his home and showed us generous hospitality for three days.
사도행전 : 28 장 8 절 His father was sick in bed, suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him and, after prayer, placed his hands on him and healed him.
사도행전 : 28 장 9 절 When this had happened, the rest of the sick on the island came and were cured.
사도행전 : 28 장 10 절 They honored us in many ways; and when we were ready to sail, they furnished us with the supplies we needed.
사도행전 : 28 장 11 절 After three months we put out to sea in a ship that had wintered in the island—it was an Alexandrian ship with the figurehead of the twin gods Castor and Pollux.
사도행전 : 28 장 12 절 We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days.
사도행전 : 28 장 13 절 From there we set sail and arrived at Rhegium. The next day the south wind came up, and on the following day we reached Puteoli.
사도행전 : 28 장 14 절 There we found some brothers and sisters who invited us to spend a week with them. And so we came to Rome.
사도행전 : 28 장 15 절 The brothers and sisters there had heard that we were coming, and they traveled as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. At the sight of these people Paul thanked God and was encouraged.
사도행전 : 28 장 16 절 When we got to Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, with a soldier to guard him.
사도행전 : 28 장 17 절 Three days later he called together the local Jewish leaders. When they had assembled, Paul said to them: “My brothers, although I have done nothing against our people or against the customs of our ancestors, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans.
사도행전 : 28 장 18 절 They examined me and wanted to release me, because I was not guilty of any crime deserving death.
사도행전 : 28 장 19 절 The Jews objected, so I was compelled to make an appeal to Caesar. I certainly did not intend to bring any charge against my own people.
사도행전 : 28 장 20 절 For this reason I have asked to see you and talk with you. It is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.”
사도행전 : 28 장 21 절 They replied, “We have not received any letters from Judea concerning you, and none of our people who have come from there has reported or said anything bad about you.
사도행전 : 28 장 22 절 But we want to hear what your views are, for we know that people everywhere are talking against this sect.”
사도행전 : 28 장 23 절 They arranged to meet Paul on a certain day, and came in even larger numbers to the place where he was staying. He witnessed to them from morning till evening, explaining about the kingdom of God, and from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets he tried to persuade them about Jesus.
사도행전 : 28 장 24 절 Some were convinced by what he said, but others would not believe.
사도행전 : 28 장 25 절 They disagreed among themselves and began to leave after Paul had made this final statement: “The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your ancestors when he said through Isaiah the prophet:
사도행전 : 28 장 26 절 “ ‘Go to this people and say,
“You will be ever hearing but never understanding;
you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.”
사도행전 : 28 장 27 절 For this people’s heart has become calloused;
they hardly hear with their ears,
and they have closed their eyes.
Otherwise they might see with their eyes,
hear with their ears,
understand with their hearts
and turn, and I would heal them.’
사도행전 : 28 장 28 절 “Therefore I want you to know that God’s salvation has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!”
사도행전 : 28 장 29 절 [29]
사도행전 : 28 장 30 절 For two whole years Paul stayed there in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him.
사도행전 : 28 장 31 절 He proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ—with all boldness and without hindrance!
